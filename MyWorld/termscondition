<p>Responsibility for User-Generated Content Posted on or Through this Site, You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post. The term "User-Generated Content"<br />refers to all of the Content that you post on or through this Site using the social networking tools we make available to you and that do not constitute Feedback (defined below). One way that User-Generated Content differs from other information you provide to us is that, once submitted, User-Generated Content is made available instantaneously to others. Examples of User- Generated Content include comments posted to discussion boards. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User-Generated Content.<br />This means that you, not MyWorld, are entirely responsible for all User-Generated Content that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the User-Generated Content you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permission to post it.<br />Because we do not control the User-Generated Content posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that User-Generated Content.
